# WUSN-based-Mining-Safety-Monitoring
The frequent mining safety accidents have caused serious casualties and huge economic losses. It is urgent for the global mining industry to increase operational efficiency and improve overall mining safety. This paper proposes a WUSN based mining safety monitoring. The monitoring system collects temperature, moisture and gas values around the mine, and then transmits the data through wireless underground sensor network, it will monitoring and updated to IOT. Here magnetic induction (MI) based transmission has been proposed; in this approach soil is medium for communication so based on the soil conductivity the measured information are transferred. This system also provides an early warning, which will be helpful to all miners present inside the mine to save their life before any casualty occurs.
